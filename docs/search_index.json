It is intended to be used as an initial training document to sit alongside the mandatory PHS Information Governance Training, and also as a helpful reference guide for LIST team members for any queries they may have around IG prior to getting in touch with us. However, we would still encourage LIST team members to reach out to Group members with any questions that have not been answered here. 1.2 The LIST IG Cross-Team Group The LIST IG Group are a cross-team group of LIST analysts who help support the wider team with any queries relating to Information Governance. The group meets regularly to discuss requests and queries, provide advice and support to fellow analysts and act as a go-between for LIST and PHS Data Protection. To contact the LIST IG Group with a query, you can either: Make a post in the LIST IG teams channel, or Get in touch with individual members of the IG Group directly. LIST IG Group Members David Readhead Craig Fraser Liz Balfour Aiden Hannah Andrew Massie Helen Tierney-Kirk If you’re interested in joining the Group, or learning more about what that would entail, we would encourage you to get in touch with us. New members are always welcome! 1.3 Mandatory PHS Training 1.3.1 Training Log You can view your IG training compliance with the LIST IG Training Log. Once you have completed the relevant courses, please update this log with your dates of completion. 1.3.2 Training Courses The following training courses are mandatory and must have been completed within the last 2 years: NSS Information Governance in Action (PHS) - Turas Module MRC: Research, GDPR and Confidentiality The LIST IG team will routinely update the training that LIST staff have completed and will remind staff to ensure this is up-to-date.

This depends on: Who the customer is NHS Board customer Local Authority customer Cluster Quality Lead (CQL) GP Practice Staff (who are not CQLs) The level of data required Level 0: Published Level 1: Aggregated Non Confidential / Publishable Level 2: Potentially Disclosive / Management Information Level 3: Patient Level Non-PHS, Local data sources Whether the data required falls into the customers own geographic area of responsibility The framework is intended to be a useful tool for analysts to determine appropriate outputs for our customers. It can be found on the LIST SharePoint Page 2.1 Our Customers LIST support two main workstreams: Health &amp; Social Care Integration and Primary Care. Under the LIST IG Framework, there are four categories of customers LIST can send PHS data directly to: NHS staff Local Authority staff – (within a Health and Social Care Partnership) Cluster Quality Leads (CQLs) GP Practice Staff (who are not CQLs) What about other customer types? ADP/CPP customers LIST’s “direct customer” should be either a local authority or NHS employee who is a member of the ADP / CPP. LIST are not permitted to share data direct with ADP/CPP members from organisations outwith of NHS Board / Local Authority Staff. These organisations are trusted partner organisations of PHS where we already have an approved mechanism for sharing data with, other organisations included in the ADP/CPPs may not have such mechanisms in place. Universities LIST do not support universities directly. LIST’s only interaction with university contacts should be via one of the 4 main customer types. For example, a HSCP may have commissioned a university to carry out analysis on their behalf. LIST only provide requested data direct to one of the 4 main customer types, never direct to the university contact. It is then for LIST’s customer to then share this data, ensuring they follow both PHS and local IG protocols as required. Third Sector LIST do not support third sector organisations directly. LIST support third sector organisations on behalf of the HSCP. LIST would provide data direct to HSCP contact(s), then the HSCP contact would be responsible for sharing this data with the third sector, ensuring they follow both PHS and local IG protocols as required. What about data which isn’t held by PHS? When we are requested to work with customers using their own local data sources, we must adhere to the local IG processes they have in place. 2.2 Comparator Data It is common for customers to request their own data in the context of comparator data from other areas, to be able to compare their performance relative to others. Below are the key considerations for LIST to determine the data they can / can’t provide without further approvals in place. Who is the customer and what information does their role entitle them to? Refer to the LIST IG framework for details on the data that different customer types are entitled to with/ without approvals. LIST can provide customers with data for their own geographic area of responsibility. We should not provide any data to a customer that means they can gain intelligence about other areas or organisations that are outwith their responsibility, unless we: Obtain senior approval from the area Use data available in the public domain – no approvals are required. What data can LIST provide if no further approvals are obtained LIST can provide data for the customer’s own geographic area of remit. LIST cannot show/name other areas in the output, this includes LIST not being permitted to show the data with anonymised names. As these areas are outwith the customers area of remit, the customer is not entitled to this data without approvals in place. LIST can provide some limited comparator data to allow the customer to see how their area compares to others. LIST can provide: Highest count/rate for the area Lowest count/rate for the area Average count/rate The relative position/rank of the customer’s area compared to others. Example 1: GP Cluster requests data to compare their own cluster against other clusters in the NHS Board or HSCP Note: LIST must ensure that there are a sufficient number of comparators that no intelligence can be gained about others. Example 2: NHS Board containing 2 HSCPs: HSCP A and HSCP B. A local authority customer from HSCP A requests comparative data for their HSCP’s relative position with their NHS Board. It is not possible to provide the maximum/minimum/average/ranking data as there are only 2 HSCPs in the NHS Board. Providing this information would be providing data for HSCP B. The local authority customer is not entitled to this data, approvals are required from HSCP B.
