It is intended to be used as an initial training document to sit alongside the mandatory PHS Information Governance Training, and also as a helpful reference guide for LIST team members for any queries they may have around IG prior to getting in touch with us. However, we would still encourage LIST team members to reach out to Group members with any questions that have not been answered here. 1.2 The LIST IG Cross-Team Group The LIST IG Group are a cross-team group of LIST analysts who help support the wider team with any queries relating to Information Governance.

To contact the LIST IG Group with a query, you can either: Make a post in the LIST IG teams channel, or Get in touch with individual members of the IG Group directly. You can find the list of current Group members in the sidebar of the LIST IG teams channel.
